# Bloch-Sphere-Visualizer

A Bloch Sphere (named after Felix Bloch) is geometrical representation of a qubit. The qubit is represented as a unit sphere, with different points on the sphere representing the different superposition values of the qubit, with the north pole and south pole being |0> and |1> respectively.

This simple tool allows the user to perform basic transformations, such as the X, Y, Z, H operations, and shows the result.

This is a very simple project, as no real math is being implemented in it. The transformations consist of simply rotating a vector about certain axes. It was a nice opportunity to learn the basics of Three.js.
